Docker Images
============

This is a set of Docker images which together form a Red Hat BPM-Suite and Red Hat Fuse ServiceWorks demo environment.
I personally use this setup whenever I have to present these topics to some audiance.

Instructions on how to install and run will follow!

Have fun and feel free to comment me with questions, improvment ideas, et. al
